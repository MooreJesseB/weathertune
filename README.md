===========

#Overview#
---

Weathertune checks the current weather of a particular location and then generates a Spofify playlist based on the results.


##Motivation##


A bit frivolous by design, I was interested in generating music playlists based on some sort of unrelated meta-data.  The weather seemed like a good place to start.

Future plans include improving the weather parsing algorithm to make more in depth searches of Spotifiy tracks.

##Technologies used##
